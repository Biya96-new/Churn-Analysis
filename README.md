Phoenow has tasked me with analyzing customer churn data from the past few months. This analysis will include customer demographics,
account information, and subscribed services. The goal is to identify factors contributing to churn and develop strategies to improve customer retention. 
Key metrics to be considered include churn rate, average revenue per customer, and number of technical support tickets.
